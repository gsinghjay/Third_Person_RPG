# Third Person RPG

## Theme/Mechanics

I want to create a FPS/RPG hack and slash video game where you will have to interact with various NPCs to solve quests such as killing specific animals or collecting specific items in order to advance to the next level. The concept is that you are in a tower, and you are trying to advance up the tower as far as you can.

### Physics
- Environmental Interaction: Implement physics-based puzzles where the player pushes boxes or manipulates objects to trigger events, open pathways, or disable traps. For example, pushing a box onto a pressure plate could open a hidden door.
- Dynamic Weather Effects (big maybe): Use physics to simulate realistic weather conditions like snowstorms or heatwaves that affect gameplay. Cold weather could slow down movement or require the player to seek warmth to prevent hypothermia, while hot conditions might deplete stamina faster.

### Internal Economy
- Resource Management: Introduce an internal economy where players collect resources like coins, health potions, or crafting materials. These resources can be used to purchase equipment, upgrade weapons, or trade with NPCs.
- Experience Points and Skills: Implement a leveling system where defeating enemies and completing quests grant experience points. Players can spend these points to improve abilities, learn new skills, or unlock magical powers.

### Progression Mechanisms
- Level Unlocking: Each floor of the tower is locked until specific quests are completed. Players might need to find keys, solve puzzles, or defeat a boss to ascend to the next level.
- Backtracking Quests: Design quests that require players to revisit lower levels, adding depth and complexity to the game world. This could involve retrieving forgotten items or solving mysteries that span multiple floors.
- Themed Floors: Each level of the tower has a unique theme (e.g., fire, ice, forest), presenting new challenges and requiring different strategies to progress.

### Tactical Maneuvering
- Stealth Mechanics: Introduce enemies that react differently based on the player's actions. For example, creatures that only move when the player isn't looking, encouraging players to be cautious and aware of their surroundings.
- Combat Strategy: Implement a combat system where positioning matters. Players can take cover behind objects, use elevation to their advantage, or set traps for enemies.
- Enemy Weaknesses: Certain enemies might be vulnerable to specific weapons or elemental attacks, requiring the player to tactically choose their equipment.

### Social Interaction
- Dynamic NPC Dialogues: Use an LLM (Language Model) to generate more natural and varied dialogues with NPCs, making interactions feel more immersive.
- Quest-Giving NPCs: NPCs provide quests that are crucial for progression. Building relationships with them could unlock additional benefits like discounts, rare items, or insider information.
- Alliances and Rivalries (big maybe): Allow players to form alliances with certain NPC factions, impacting the game's storyline and available quests.

### Additional Mechanics and Features
- Weapon and Magic System: Utilize different controls for varied combat options:
  - Left Click: Activate a shield to block attacks.
  - Right Click: Swing your sword for melee combat.
  - Mouse Wheel Click: Cast spells like fireballs or shoot arrows.
- Raycasting for Targeting: Implement raycasting to accurately detect what the player is aiming at, ensuring that spells and arrows hit their intended targets.
- Health and Survival Mechanics: Incorporate survival elements where players must monitor their health, stamina, and perhaps even hunger or thirst, especially with the added challenge of weather effects.
